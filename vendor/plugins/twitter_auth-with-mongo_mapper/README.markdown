TwitterAuth is an awesome gem written by mbleigh, which you can check out [here](http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth/).

MongoMapper is an awesome gem written by jnunemaker, which you can check out [here](http://github.com/jnunemaker).

This was a proof of concept for using them together. Really very little needed to be changed.
